# Pic16F887
PIC16F887 is a 40-pin (for PDIP package) and 8-bit CMOS PIC Microcontroller that comes with nanoWatt technology. Economical price and user-friendly architecture make this device easy to use and easy to configure.
It is available in three packages known as PDIP, QFN, and TQFP. The first one comes with a 40-pin layout design while remaining two contains 44 pins on each layout.
This PIC version, like other models in the PIC community, contains everything that is required to make an embedded system and drive automation.
The PIC16F887 incorporates 256 bytes of EEPROM data memory, 368 bytes of RAM, and program memory of 8K.
Apart from self-programming capability, it also contains 2 Comparators,10-bit Analog-to-Digital (A/D) converter with 14 channels, and capture, compare and PWM functions.
The asynchronous serial port is added on the chip that can be configured both ways i.e. the 2-wire Inter-Integrated Circuit (I²C™) Bus or 3-wire Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI™)
The Enhanced Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (EUSART) feature makes this chip compatible with the devices where serial communication is an integral part of the project.
The functions that make this device unique in terms of ease of use include
Power-Saving Sleep mode
Industrial and Extended Temperature range
Wide operating voltage range (2.0V-5.5V)
SR Latch mode
Power-up Timer (PWRT) and Oscillator Start-up Timer (OST)
Power-on Reset (POR)
Ultra-Low-Power Wake-up (ULPWU)
Multiplexed Master Clear with pull-up/input pin
Individually programmable weak pull-ups
Brown-out Reset (BOR) with software control option
Enhanced low-current Watchdog Timer (WDT)
